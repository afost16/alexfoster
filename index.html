        <p>My research in human-robot interaction
            (HRI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) has helped researchers better conduct
            research for people living with dementia and their carepartners. I am particularly interested in
            studying
            communities and subcultures like these that require extra care in this digital era. Ultimately, I want
            to develop timeless
            systems and methods that serve as counterbalances to
            rapid technological advancement so people can live healthier lives with technology.</p>

            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>I graduated in December 2024 with my Bachelor's in Informatics with a focus in Human-Computer
                Interaction, and minors in Human-Centered Design and Web Design and Development at
                <a href="https://bloomington.iu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indiana University</a>.
                I was born in Upstate New York, and I have lived in
                Indiana and Ireland. When I'm not researching or doing
                schoolwork, I enjoy weightlifting,
                bouldering, cooking
                vegan food,
                and
                watching my favorite soccer team, Manchester United.
